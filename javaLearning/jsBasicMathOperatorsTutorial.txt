true + false ====== 1
6 / "3" ===== 2
"2" * "3" ===== 6
4 + 5 + "px" ===== "9px"
"$" + 4 + 5 ===== "$45"
"4" - 2 ===== 2
"4px" - 2 ===== NaN
"  -9  " + 5 ===== "  -9  5"

Fix the addition
importance: 5
Hereâ€™s a code that asks the user for two numbers and shows their sum.

It works incorrectly. The output in the example below is 12 (for default prompt values).

Why? Fix it. The result should be 3.

let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);

alert(a + b); // 12

/////
prompt is converting the numbers to strings. +a and +b converts them back to numbers.

let a = prompt("First number?", 1);
let b = prompt("Second number?", 2);

alert(+a + +b); // 3
